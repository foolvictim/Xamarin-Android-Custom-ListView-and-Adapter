# Xamarin-Android-Custom-ListView-and-Adapter
This contains a  customisable ListView Adapter. And a small project that shows the created list.
You can add ".axml" files to "Projectname/Resources/layout" directory.
And you can add ".cs" files to the main directory of your project.

# How this works?
You're gonna modify and use this codes on your projects.

# Main.axml File
This is a layout file for Main page of your application.

# listview_row.axml File
This is gonna be our own custom ListView's layout. Careful about ID's!

# MainActivity.cs File
You know that.

# MyListViewAdapter.cs File
This is our own ListView Adapter.

# Person.cs File
This creates a variable type to use multiple strings in our ListView.



Regards.
